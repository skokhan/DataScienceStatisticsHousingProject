# Statistics for Data Science with Python: Boston Housing Project by IBM

This Statistics for Data Science course is designed to introduce you to the basic principles of statistical methods and procedures used for data analysis. After completing this course you will have practical knowledge of crucial topics in statistics including: 

* Data gathering;
* Summarizing data using descriptive statistics;
* Displaying and visualizing data;
* Examining relationships between variables;
* Probability distributions;
* Expected values;
* Hypothesis testing;
* Introduction to ANOVA (analysis of variance), regression and correlation analysis.

You will take a hands-on approach to statistical analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebooks â€“ the tools of choice for Data Scientists and Data Analysts.

At the end of the course, you will complete a project to apply various concepts in the course to a Data Science problem involving a real-life inspired scenario and demonstrate an understanding of the foundational statistical thinking and reasoning. The focus is on developing a clear understanding of the different approaches for different data types, developing an intuitive understanding, making appropriate assessments of the proposed methods, using Python to analyze our data, and interpreting the output accurately.

## Learning Objectives

* Calculate and apply measures of central tendency and measures of dispersion to grouped and ungrouped data;
* Summarize, present, and visualize data in a clear and concise way that provides practical insights for non-statisticians needing the results;
* Identify appropriate hypothesis tests to use for common data sets;
* Conduct hypothesis tests, correlation tests, and regression analysis;
* Demonstrate proficiency in statistical analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Project Scenario and Overwiev
You are a Data Scientist with a housing agency in Boston MA, you have been given access to a previous dataset on housing prices derived from the U.S. Census Service to present insights to higher management. Based on your experience in Statistics, what information can you provide them to help with making an informed decision? Upper management will like to get some insight into the following.  

* Is there a significant difference in the Median Value of Houses bounded by the Charles River or not?  
* Is there a difference in Median Values of Houses of each Proportion of Owner-occupied Units built before 1940?  
* Can we conclude that there is no relationship between Nitric Oxide Concentrations and the Proportion of Non-retail Business Acres per Town?  
* What is the impact of an additional Weighted Distance to the five Boston Employment Centres on the Median Value of Owner-occupied Homes?  

Using the appropriate graphs and charts, generate basic statistics and visualizations that you think will be useful for the upper management to give them important insight given the question they are asking, in your graphs, include an explanation of each statistic.

## Approach

Utilize descriptive and inferential statistical methods along with appropriate data visualizations to explore the dataset:

* Basic descriptive statistics for key variables;
* Data visualizations such as boxplots, bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots;
* Statistical tests including t-tests, ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and linear regression where relevant;
* Clear interpretations and explanations for each graph and statistical result to ensure practical insights for non-statisticians involved in decision-making.
